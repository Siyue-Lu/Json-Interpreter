# Changelog - VR Builder

**v3.1.0 (2023/07/12 - Current)**

*[Added]*
- Parallel Execution node: this node works similarly to the Step Group node but lets you create multiple paths which are independent from one another and executed at the same time. The Parallel Execution node completes when all paths have ended.

*[Changed]*
- When the process file is changed externally (e.g. because of source control) and the Process Editor is open, a dialog will appear asking which data to use.

*[Fixed]*
- Fixed tags not saved when created from the inspector.
- Replaced FindObjectsByType call with FindObjectsOfType for better backwards compatibility.
- Fixed confetti machine not working in demo scene.
- Removed a few instances where the process file was saved unnecessarily.
- Fix for chapter started and step started in Process Runner events being called repeatedly.
- Fix for editor icon not found error.

**v3.0.1 (2023/06/05)**

*[Added]*
- Added menu entry that directly links to the roadmap.

*[Changed]*
- Snap zones now require to select a material for the base highlight instead of a color. This adds flexibility and is consistent with the valid/invalid materials.
- When pasting nodes in the process editor, those are now pasted on the mouse cursor's position instead of the same position as the copied nodes.

*[Fixed]*
- Fixed process editor losing focus when step is selected.
- Fixed issue with copied object references using the Duplicate Chapter button.
- Fixed hand animations not working as intended.
- Snap zone preview mesh is updated when the highlight settings are changed.

**v3.0.0 (2023/04/24)**

*[Added]*
- Added custom overrides `Teleportation Anchor (VR Builder)` and `Teleportation Area (VR Builder)`. Those should be used instead of the XRI defaults and will provide automated configuration and other useful features in the future.
- Added Dummy Text-to-speech provider. This provider generates blank files and can be used as a fallback on hardware that does not support the default Microsoft SAPI provider.
- Added support for property extensions, which are components that are automatically added along with a certain scene object property. To create your extensions, override `ISceneObjectPropertyExtension<TProperty>` and ensure the relevant assembly is listed in the scene configuration (see below).
- The PROCESS_CONFIGURATION object now includes an additional `Scene Configuration` component. This stores configuration pertinent to the scene, but not necessarily the whole project. At the moment, the configuration defines which assembly should be checked for property extensions and the default confetti prefab.

*[Changed]*
- VR Builder now requires and supports XRI 2.3.1 and later.
- All properties now use Unity events instead of C# events. This allows users to more easily use them with their own logic in the Unity inspector.
- Behaviors and conditions now are dynamically named. Names are more informative and are not stored in the process JSON anymore.
- Spawning objects and enabling/disabling objects and components now has an additional abstraction layer between the relevant behaviors and the Unity logic. This allows to handle these things differently in custom implementations, e.g. our upcoming multiuser support. Custom behaviors interacting with gameobject in these ways should do so through the `SceneObjectManager` found in the runtime configuration.
- Obsoleted the `InstructionPlayer` audio source reference in the runtime configuration. The Play Audio behavior and other behaviors playing audio should use the abstracted `ProcessAudioPlayer` instead.

*[Fixed]*
- Fixed Step Inspector window occasionally duplicating itself on recompile.
- Fixed tags not saved properly on prefab objects.

**v2.8.0 (2023/03/10)**

*[Added]*
- New variant of the *Snap Object* behavior that allows to snap any object with a given tag in a specified snap zone.
- Added *Duplicate Chapter* button to the chapter list in the step inspector. It can be used to create a copy of the currently selected chapter.

*[Changed]*
- The *Snap Object by Reference* condition now supports leaving one object reference field empty. This way, the condition will complete either when the user snaps a specific object in any snap zone, or when any object is snapped in a specific snap zone. Note that manual unlocking of objects or snap zones may be required, and fast forwarding will not automatically snap anything if a field is empty.

*[Fixed]*
- Copy/paste should now work as expected.
- Automated setup for OpenXR-based headsets should now work as expected.
- Change the way the step inspector focuses when a step is selected. This should help with the step inspector disappearing on macOS.

**v2.7.1 (2023-02-01)**

*[Changed]*
- Changed the way text-to-speech audio works: it is no longer possible to generate TTS audio at runtime. This will ensure a build works consistently regardless of which machine is running on, as audio for builds will always be synthesized and stored in advance. Missing/changed audio is automatically generated when creating the build. Buttons to manually generate/flush files have been added in Project Settings > VR Builder > Language.
- Refactored the TTS system to make it easier to add new TTS providers modularly, without the need to edit VR Builder files.
- Improvements to the drawer of the Play Audio/TTS behavior in the Step Inspector.
- Removed support for Google (v1) and Watson TTS providers.
- It is now possible to build a VR Builder project on WebGL. Note that WebGL does not support VR, but this can be useful for some advanced, custom use cases.

*[Fixed]*
- It is now possible to build for Android using IL2CPP with managed stripping set to "Minimal" - before, this had to be set to "Low" as a workaround.
- Grouping many steps in step groups no longer breaks the process JSON.

*[Known Issues]*
- TTS might not work properly on WebGL builds.

**v2.7.0 (2023-01-17)**

*[Added]*
- New "Step Group" node which can be used to group together a cluster of nodes and improve graph organization. Existing nodes can be grouped from the context menu, or an empty group can be created and populated. Caveats: currently the group node only has one input and one output. End Chapter nodes are not supported in step groups. Nested step groups are not recommended.

*[Changed]*
- Changed teleportation logic and updated rigs accordingly to improve reliability. Anchors and teleportation areas now need their Teleport Trigger to be set to "On Deactivated". This is taken care of automatically when autoconfiguring teleportation anchors, but already configured anchors/areas will not work as intended with the new rig and viceversa. Note that you will need to delete the rig and re-perform setup to create an up-to-date one in an existing scene.

*[Fixed]*
- Fixed process not loading correctly on some IL2CPP Android builds.
- Fixed scene object reference to a child in a prefab becoming invalid when the prefab is edited.
- Fixed process scene objects in additively loaded scene not registering.
- Fixed process scene objects in additively loaded scene requesting a new unique name on load.

**v2.6.0 (2022-12-01)**

*[Added]*
- New "End Chapter" node which can be used as an exit node and lets you specify which chapter will start next. This makes it possible to build non-linear processes where some chapters are skipped or you return back to previous ones!
- Scene Object Tag system: now a Process Scene Object can have a number of tags in addition to its unique name. This allows for manipulating scene objects in bulk instead of always relying on a unique reference.
- Scene Object Tag variation for the following behaviors/conditions: Enable/Disable Object, Enable/Disable Component, Grab Object. This makes it possible, for example, to disable all object with a given tag or to have a grab condition for an unspecified object with the relevant tag.
- Enable/Disable Component behaviors, which enable or disable all components of a specified type on the target object.

*[Changed]*
- Renamed the Workflow Editor to Process Editor.
- New node creation is now nested under the "New" context menu.

*[Fixed]*
- Fixed the Step Inspector taking a long time to open for the first time after loading the project. The time-consuming operations are now performed in the background when the project is loaded or recompiles.
- Fixed a build error when attempting to build while the Process Editor is open.
- Various other fixes and improvements.

*[Known Issues]*
- When importing in an empty project in Unity 2021.3.14, the editor can crash instead of restarting. If that's the case, just restart the editor manually and let the process finish.

**v2.5.1 (2022-10-18)**

*[Changed]*
- Renamed and reprioritized the process controllers. The Default process controller is now called Spectator, and the Standalone is now called Standard. The Standard process controller is now selected by default. After this update, you might have to re-select the Spectator process controller if you were using it in existing scenes!
- Overhauled the inspector for the Bezier Spline component. It is now possible to delete the last curve added and to select and edit the individual control points from the inspector, in order to avoid situations where a point would become unselectable due to overlapping.

**v2.5.0 (2022-09-30)**

*[Added]*
- Rebuilt the demo scene from scratch. Along with much improved graphics, the new scene includes a more complex linear process that better showcases the possibilities of the core VR Builder. Try it out!
- The workflow editor window now remembers the zoom and panning of the different chapters as long as it stays open. Closing and reopening the window will show the graph at its default position.
- Added option to open the demo scene right after the project setup wizard.

*[Changed]*
- The hardware setup wizard now allows to choose from a list of devices instead of APIs. This should make initial setup more user-friendly.
- Removed the blocking dialogs when installing hardware-related packages after the setup wizard has been closed.
- Removed the blocking dialog when opening the demo scene from the menu.
- Changed the default position of the start node in the workflow editor window.

*[Fixed]*
- Fixed a couple issues leaving hanging connections in the workflow editor.
- The touchable property now recognizes being touched only by interactors that are part of the VR rig. This avoids object being accidentally "touched" by random snap zones.
- The Move Object behavior resets object velocity before and after the behavior. This avoid an object resuming its momentum after the behavior has ended.
- XR loaders should now stay selected after automated hardware setup.

*[Known Issues]*
- Copying a group of nodes in the workflow editor will disconnect the original nodes from the first non-copied node.
- Deleting a pasted node can cause connection on the original node to be deleted.

**v2.4.0 (2022-08-25)**

*[Added]*
- Added new rig with animated hands in place of controllers. The new rig is the default for newly created scenes, but the old one is still available as a prefab. Note that this will not automatically update the rig in a previously created scene. To do so, delete the existing rig then respawn it by selecting Tools > VR Builder > Setup Scene for VR Process.

*[Changed]*
- The Setup Wizard has been split in Project Setup Wizard and Scene Setup Wizard. The Project Setup Wizard opens after importing VR Builder and allows to configure the project. The Scene Setup Wizard should be called to create or configure a new VR Builder scene. Both wizards are available from the menu. This will allow us to extend and specialize them in the future.
- Updated behavior and condition help links. Clicking on the question mark on a behavior/condition's header in the Step Inspector will open the relevant VR Builder documentation.
- Updated XR Interaction Toolkit dependency to version 2.1.1.

**v2.3.2 (2022-08-04)**

*[Added]*
- Added utility functions to some data properties, useful to change a data property value e.g. through a Unity event. There is a function that increases a number data property and one that inverts the value of a boolean data property.

*[Changed]*
- Data properties now use Unity events, therefore it is possible to bind functions in the inspector that are executed when the value of the property changes or is reset.

*[Fixed]*
- Fixed issue where teleporting to an anchor did not always succeed.
- Fixed issue where Unity 2021+ got stuck while importing VR Builder for the first time.
- Fixed progress bar for VR Builder dependency import.

**v2.3.1 (2022-07-20)**

*[Changed]*
- Updates related to the Menus add-on.
- A warning will be displayed when using custom meshes as snap zone highlights. The meshes need to be set readable in order for the highlights to be displayed in builds.

**v2.3.0 (2022-07-06)**

*[Added]*
- Added support for displaying a 0-1 slider in the step inspector.
- Added type value to step metadata, in order to support different step visualization strategies.
- Entities can now retrieve their parent.

**v2.2.1 (2022-06-14)**

*[Fixed]*
- Fixed build error due to incorrectly set assembly platforms in the VRBuilder.Editor.PackageManager.XRInteraction assembly.


**v2.2.0 (2022-06-10)**

*[Added]*
- Streamlined scene setup by spawning a default rig in the scene instead of rig loader and dummy user prefabs. This makes it easier and more intuitive to customize or replace the rig. VR Builder remains compatible with scenes created with previous versions, and it is still possible to manually add the rig loader for advanced use cases. Note: if using Unity 2019 and OpenVR, the default rig needs to be manually replaced with the [XR_Setup_Device_Based] prefab.

*[Fixed]*
- Fixed bug with Object in Collider condition completing instantly when it should not in some cases.
- Fixed incorrect snap zone materials when using URP.
- Minor improvements to the node editor UI.


**v2.1.0 (2022-05-11)**

*[Added]*
- First iteration of a new node editor based on Unity’s GraphView API. This more flexible system will allow us to more easily make improvements to the node editor. Benefits from the switch include the ability to zoom the graph, select and drag multiple nodes and to rename a node by double clicking on its name. Processes created with previous versions are compatible but nodes may need rearranging.

*[Changed]*
- VR Builder does not include anymore a Newtonsoft JSON plugin, but instead downloads and uses the version from Unity’s Package Manager. This should offer better compatibility and allows to build for ARM64 with IL2CPP, which is relevant for Android headsets like the Oculus Quest devices. In Unity 2021+, Manage Stripping Level in the Player Settings needs to be raised to Low in order for the build to succeed.

*[Known Issues]*
- Double clicking to rename a node does not work on Unity 2019.


**v2.0.0 (2022-04-01)**

*[Added]*
- Unsnap Object behavior to unsnap objects from snap zones in the process logic.
- New Process Wizard is visible on iOS devices.

*[Changed]*
- External downloads are no longer required: VR Builder now includes everything in the Unity Asset Store package.
- The XR Interaction Component can be disabled in VR Builder’s project settings if needed, e.g. if you want to use another interaction framework.
- XR Interaction Component is now based on XR Interaction Toolkit v2.0.0.


**v1.3.0 (2022-03-07)**

*[Added]*
- Improved logging: Option to log data property changes in the project settings so that you can easily debug data properties.
- Technical refactoring for States & Data add-on.

*[Changed]*
- Data property operations work in the States & Data add-on


**v1.2.1 (2022-02-23)**

*[Added]*
- Better accessibility to helpful information: Links to Add-ons & Integrations overview page and Interhaptics integration added in menu and documentation.


**v1.2.0 (2022-02-11)**

*[Added]*
- Technical refactoring for Track & Measure add-on.

*[Changed]*
- Renaming menu items for improved naming convention.
- Users are warned to make a back-up when adding VR Builder to existing projects.
- Choice between "required" and "latest" version in the VR Builder downloader.
- Renamed "Create New Process..." to “New Process Wizard”.

*[Fixed]*
- Error when dragging Process Scene Object prefabs into the scene


**v1.1.0 (2022-01-21)**

*[Added]*
- New "Set Parent" behavior: Allows to change the parent of a scene object in the hierarchy.
- Improved usability for Bezier spline paths: Option to approximate a linear progression on the curve to better control the speed of movements.

**v1.0.0 (2022-01-10)**

*[Changed]*
- The XR interaction component has been modularized so that you can use other interaction components instead.
- Renaming training-related terminology in the code: "training/course" became "process", "trainee" became "user".
